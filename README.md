#What is unityserializer-ng?#
unityserialier-ng is a fork of Mike Talbot's Unity Serializer asset; A complete save solution for games made with Unity 5. 

#What's wrong with the original Unity Serializer?#
It has been discontinued some time ago. While Unity has been updated a lot, the US (Unity Serializer) hasn't been since 2013. Bug fixes, stability improvements and support for completely new features did not happen. The way US has been written, ensured that it will be flexible enough to not fully break on each update. As a result, it kept working with Unity 4. However, the Unity 5 update was the straw that finally broke the camel's neck and made US stop working.
unityserializer-ng is a continuation of Mike's excellent project. I decided to fork and change its name, in order to prevent confusion. This fork will not be backwards compatible to the old Unity Serializer. It's made for Unity 5, which will enable me to remove old legacy bloat whenever I find it. The old Unity Serializer still works for Unity 4.6 and is available for download on the Unity Asset Store.
